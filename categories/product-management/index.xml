      <description>&lt;p&gt;Design Thinking has really had a major impact on the way we innovate within software teams. I thought it would be interesting to illustrate how it could integrate with the software development lifecycle - showing how it aligns to a solution team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a visualisation of a sales pipeline. It&amp;rsquo;s a bubble chart mapping sales stage to the horizontal axis, and opportunity size to the size of each data point. I&amp;rsquo;ve applied an arbitrary algorithm to create the funnel effect on the vertical axis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a qualitative report card produced for some inherited enterprise software code base. I designed the dimensions to ensure we produced an holistic view. Speed was vital - so there are no time to become bogged down in analysis paralysis. So I created set of survey tools for each dimension and had relevant experts provide their input.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to make things easy and repeatable.

I packaged it into a methodology and produced supporting collateral.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
