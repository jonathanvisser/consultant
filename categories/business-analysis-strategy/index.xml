      <description>&lt;p&gt;This risk analysis report was created by detailed review of a risk log - sizing/pricing potential impact both before and after identified countermeasures had been applied. Each risk was further categorised and tagged to help improve risk management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made project risks clear, actionable, and helped establish a fair basis for any fixed-price negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
